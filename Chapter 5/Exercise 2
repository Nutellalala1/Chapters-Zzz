#A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.

#Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store 

#their meanings as values.

#Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print 

#the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between 

#each word-meaning pair in your output.


# Create a dictionary called glossary
glossary = {
    "variable": "A name given to a value.",
    "loop": "A block of code that repeats until a certain condition is met.",
    "list": "A collection of items that can be of any data type.",
    "function": "A block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of your program.",
    "conditional statement": "A statement that executes a block of code if a certain condition is true."
}

# Print each word and its meaning
for word, meaning in glossary.items():
    print(f"{word}:")
    print(f"  {meaning}\n")
