# Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from Exercise 6-3 (page 99) by replacing your series of print() 
# calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values. When you’re sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms 
# to your glossary.When you run your program again, these new words and meanings should automatically be included in the output.
