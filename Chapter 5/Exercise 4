# Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair might be 'nile': 'egypt'.

# * Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs through Egypt.

# * Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.

# * Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.

# Dictionary of rivers and countries
rivers = {
    'nile': 'egypt',
    'amazon': 'brazil',
    'yangtze': 'china'
}

# Loop to print a sentence about each river
for river, country in rivers.items():
    print(f"The {river.capitalize()} runs through {country.capitalize()}.")

# Loop to print the name of each river
for river in rivers.keys():
    print(river.capitalize())

# Loop to print the name of each country
for country in rivers.values():
