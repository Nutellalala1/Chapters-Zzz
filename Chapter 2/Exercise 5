#A girl heads to a computer shop to buy some USB sticks. She loves USB sticks and wants as many as she can get for £50. They are £6 each.
#Write a programme that calculates how many USB sticks she can buy and how many pounds she will have left.
#You will to use the arithmetic operators to complete this exercise.


# Define the price of a single USB stick
usb_stick_price = 6

# Define the girl's budget
budget = 50

# Calculate the number of USB sticks she can buy
num_usb_sticks = budget // usb_stick_price

# Calculate the remaining budget
remaining_budget = budget % usb_stick_price

print(f"She can buy {num_usb_sticks} USB sticks.")
print(f"She will have £{remaining_budget} left.")
