#Tidy up the code to make it easier to understand
#Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, “\t” and “\n”, at least once.
#Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
#Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().


name = "\t\nJohn Smith\t\n"

print("Original name:")
print(name)

print("\nName with lstrip():")
print(name.lstrip())

print("\nName with rstrip():")
print(name.rstrip())

print("\nName with strip():")
print(name.strip())
